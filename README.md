# dungeon-zerg

Clutter the map with Zerglings!\
A mod for Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna.

FOSS, CC-BY-SA.


## About

This mod adds masses of Zerglings into the game. It does this by generating 8 Zerglings next to each enemy.

The Zerglings have very little health, damage or XP, and no loot - they won't break balancing.


## Note

The Dungeon Siege engine was not made for having hundreds of actors within the frustum. Handle with care. Running through is not advised.


## Installation & Compatibility

- Put the dsres file into the DSLOA folder.
- Requires DSLOA, not compatible with vanilla DS1.
- This mod overwrites the core templates file among other things - incompatibilities with other mods may occur.
