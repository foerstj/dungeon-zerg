# dungeon-zerg

Clutter the map with Zerglings!\
A mod for Dungeon Siege.

FOSS, CC-BY-SA.


## About

This mod adds masses of Zerglings into the game. It does this by generating 8 Zerglings next to each enemy.

The Zerglings have very little health, damage or XP, and no loot - they won't break balancing.


## Note

The Dungeon Siege engine was not made for having hundreds of actors within the frustum. Handle with care. Running through is not advised.


## Installation & Compatibility

- Either, if you use vanilla DS1: put the "Dungeon Zerg - Vanilla.dsres" file into your Resources folder.
- Or, if you use DS LoA: Put the "Dungeon Zerg - LoA.dsres" file into your DSLOA folder.
- Don't add both files - for some reason, the LoA file does not take precedence over the Vanilla file.
- This mod overwrites the core templates file among other things - incompatibilities with other mods may occur.
